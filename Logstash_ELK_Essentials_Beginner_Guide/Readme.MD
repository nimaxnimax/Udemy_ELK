**Optional Technical Skills:**
- **Basic Knowledge of Command Line:** Familiarity with using command-line interfaces.
- **Understanding of JSON:** Basic comprehension of JSON formatting and structure.
- **Networking Concepts:** Basic understanding of networking and data flow.

**Optional Soft Skills:**
- **Analytical Thinking:** Ability to analyze data and troubleshoot issues.
- **Attention to Detail:** Keen eye for detail when configuring and managing data pipelines.
- **Problem-Solving:** Strong problem-solving skills for diagnosing and resolving data processing issues.

**Who Should Attend This Course:**
- **IT Professionals:** Individuals working in IT infrastructure, operations, or support roles.
- **Data Analysts:** Professionals looking to enhance their data processing and analysis capabilities.
- **Developers:** Developers interested in integrating log management and analysis into their applications.
- **System Administrators:** Administrators responsible for maintaining and monitoring server logs.
- **Students:** Anyone interested in learning about data processing and log management tools.

**This Course Is For:**
- **Beginners:** Individuals with no prior experience in Logstash or the ELK stack.
- **Career Changers:** Professionals looking to transition into roles involving data processing and analysis.
- **Enhancers:** Existing professionals seeking to broaden their skill set with log management and data visualization tools.

Throughout this course, you will explore the core components of the ELK stack and how they interact with each other. You will learn the essentials of setting up and configuring Logstash, integrating it with Elasticsearch and Kibana, and applying best practices for data processing and log management.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of Logstash and the ELK stack, empowering you to effectively manage, analyze, and visualize your data. Whether you are an IT professional, a data analyst, or simply someone interested in log management, this course will provide you with the skills needed to leverage these powerful tools in your work.

How To Install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (Elastic Stack) on Ubuntu 22.04

Step 1 — Installing and Configuring Elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch components are not available in Ubuntu’s default package repositories. They can, however, be installed with APT after adding Elastic’s package source list.

All of the packages are signed with the Elasticsearch signing key in order to protect your system from package spoofing. Packages which have been authenticated using the key will be considered trusted by your package manager. In this step, you will import the Elasticsearch public GPG key and add the Elastic package source list in order to install Elasticsearch.

To begin, use cURL, the command line tool for transferring data with URLs, to import the Elasticsearch public GPG key into APT. Note that we are using the arguments -fsSL to silence all progress and possible errors (except for a server failure) and to allow cURL to make a request on a new location if redirected. Pipe the output of the curl command to the gpg --dearmor command, which converts the key into a format that apt can use to verify downloaded packages.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch |sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elastic.gpg
```

Next, add the Elastic source list to the sources.list.d directory, where APT will search for new sources:

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elastic.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
```

The [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elastic.gpg] portion of the file instructs apt to use the key that you downloaded to verify repository and file information for Elasticsearch packages.

Next, update your package lists so APT will read the new Elastic source:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
```

Then install Elasticsearch with this command:

```bash
sudo apt install elasticsearch -y
```

Elasticsearch is now installed and ready to be configured. Use your preferred text editor to edit Elasticsearch’s main configuration file, elasticsearch.yml. Here, we’ll use nano:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```

Note: Elasticsearch’s configuration file is in YAML format, which means that we need to maintain the indentation format. Be sure that you do not add any extra spaces as you edit this file.

The elasticsearch.yml file provides configuration options for your cluster, node, paths, memory, network, discovery, and gateway. Most of these options are preconfigured in the file but you can change them according to your needs. For the purposes of our demonstration of a single-server configuration, we will only adjust the settings for the network host.

Elasticsearch listens for traffic from everywhere on port 9200. You will want to restrict outside access to your Elasticsearch instance to prevent outsiders from reading your data or shutting down your Elasticsearch cluster through its [REST API]. To restrict access and therefore increase security, find the line that specifies network.host, uncomment it, and replace its value with localhost like this:

```bash
/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
. . .
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
network.host: localhost
. . .
```

We have specified localhost so that Elasticsearch listens on all interfaces and bound IPs. If you want it to listen only on a specific interface, you can specify its IP in place of localhost. Save and close elasticsearch.yml. If you’re using nano, you can do so by pressing CTRL+X, followed by Y and then ENTER .

These are the minimum settings you can start with in order to use Elasticsearch. Now you can start Elasticsearch for the first time.

Start the Elasticsearch service with systemctl. Give Elasticsearch a few moments to start up. Otherwise, you may get errors about not being able to connect.

```bash
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
```

Next, run the following command to enable Elasticsearch to start up every time your server boots:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
```

You can test whether your Elasticsearch service is running by sending an HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200"
```

You will see a response showing some basic information about your local node, similar to this:

```bash
Output
{
  "name" : "Elasticsearch",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "n8Qu5CjWSmyIXBzRXK-j4A",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.17.2",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "de7261de50d90919ae53b0eff9413fd7e5307301",
    "build_date" : "2022-03-28T15:12:21.446567561Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "8.11.1",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Now that Elasticsearch is up and running, let’s install Kibana, the next component of the Elastic Stack.
